 # NexAI - AI Agent – Full Stack AI-powered Code Assistant

NexAI is an AI-driven full-stack code assistant that transforms natural language into working code, intelligently understands context, and helps developers with code generation, debugging, and refactoring.
Built with Node.js, Express, and the OpenAI API, this assistant enables a seamless developer experience through real-time synchronization, intelligent file management, and secure backend architecture.

🚀 Features

🗣️ Natural Language to Code Conversion
Converts user prompts into syntactically correct and optimized code snippets using the OpenAI API.

🧩 Modular Backend Architecture
Built with a clean separation of concerns — controllers, services, middleware, and routes — ensuring scalability and maintainability.

🔐 Secure Authentication System
Implements JWT-based authentication with a token blacklist for enhanced security and controlled session management.

📁 Dynamic File Tree Management
Supports real-time file creation, editing, updates, and synchronization between the client and server.

🤖 AI Reasoning Layer
Understands code context and offers intelligent suggestions, assisting in debugging, refactoring, and optimization.

⚙️ Scalable RESTful APIs
Designed to integrate seamlessly with front-end clients and support future microservices.

🐳 Containerized Deployment
Deployed in a Docker-based containerized environment, enabling high availability and modular service orchestration.
